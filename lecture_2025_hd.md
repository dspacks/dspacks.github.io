# The Built Environment and Health Disparities
## A Health Informatics Perspective

???
Opening (30s):
* Welcome audience
* Introduce yourself and credentials
* "Today we're exploring how our physical environment shapes health outcomes"
* "Focus on data-driven understanding and solutions"

---

# Introduction (2 min)
